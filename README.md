The goal of the project is to implement an online system which is implemented using a relational DBMS that supports standard SQL queries, views, functions and stored procedures.

Given an Entity-Relationship diagram which summarizes all the relationships and the characteristics of each of the tables (among which columns, foreign keys), a set of views, stored procedures was described, an interface on HTML was designed, and server on Python was coded to create the online system.
